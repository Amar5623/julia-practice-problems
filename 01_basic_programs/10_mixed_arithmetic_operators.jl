# Program to demonstrate mixed arithmetic operators in Julia

# Declare variables
x = 5
y = 3
z = 2

# Perform mixed arithmetic operations
result = x + y * z / (y - z)

# Print the result
println("Result of mixed arithmetic operations: ", result)

# Output:
# Result of mixed arithmetic operations: 11.0
