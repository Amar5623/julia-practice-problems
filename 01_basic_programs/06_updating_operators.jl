# Program to demonstrate updating operators in Julia

# Declare a variable
x = 5

# Update the variable using different operators
x += 2  # Increment by 2
x -= 3  # Decrement by 3
x *= 4  # Multiply by 4

# Print the final value of x
println("Updated value of x: ", x)

# Output:
# Updated value of x: 8
