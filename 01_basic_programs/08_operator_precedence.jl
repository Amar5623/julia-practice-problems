# Program to demonstrate operator precedence in Julia

# Declare variables
x = 10
y = 5
z = 2

# Perform an operation with multiple operators
result = x + y * z  # According to precedence, multiplication is done first

# Print the result
println("Result (x + y * z): ", result)

# Output:
# Result (x + y * z): 20
